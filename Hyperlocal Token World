“Hyperlocal Token Worlds” – Campus / City Micro‑Economies
Perfect fit for you as a student.

Build a geofenced token experience: your campus/city has its own token universe (clubs, events, meme tokens), all minted via Bags.
​

QR codes at events: scan to claim attendance tokens or hidden “loot” tokens deployed earlier from your backend.

Twists:

“Campus Seasons”: at the end of a semester, the system auto‑compiles your social graph and events into a collectible Season Pass token.

Cross‑campus wars: different campuses run similar systems and can compete on “most active culture” metrics.
